Build an Actionsflow workflow:

1. **Uncomment [`.github/workflows/actionsflow.yml`](/.github/workflows/actionsflow.yml) schedule event**

    ```yml
    on:
      schedule:
        - cron: "*/15 * * * *"
    ```
    > Note: To prevent abuse, by default, the schedule is commented, please modify the schedule time according to your own needs, the default is once every 15 minutes. Learn more about schedule event, please see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)

1. **Define your [workflow file](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/workflow/) at `workflows` directory**

   A typical workflow file `rss.yml` looks like this:

   ```yaml
   on:
     rss:
       url: https://hnrss.org/newest?points=300&count=3
   jobs:
     request:
       name: Make a HTTP Request
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Make a HTTP Request
           uses: actionsflow/axios@v1
           with:
             url: https://hookb.in/VGPzxoWbdjtE22bwznzE
             method: POST
             body: |
               {
                 "link":"${{ on.rss.outputs.link }}", 
                 "title": "${{ on.rss.outputs.title }}",
                 "content":"<<<${{ on.rss.outputs.contentSnippet }}>>>"
               }
   ```
